Web UI for Testing Your DualShock 4 Device: This Web UI allows you to perform tests on all buttons of your device. It provides the opportunity to check the performance of buttons that work with a click, as well as those that obtain values when pressed. You can test the responsiveness of both clickable buttons and those that register values upon pressing.
